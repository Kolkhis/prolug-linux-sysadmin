# ProLUG 101
## Unit 14 Worksheet
## Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to
send to me at the end of the course.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 1
Refer to your Unit 5 scan of the systems.
You know that Ansible is a tool that you want to maintain in the environment.

Review this online documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html

1. Make an inventory of the servers, grouped any way you like.

```ini
[rocky_boxes]
192.168.200.[50:69]

[]

```

2. What format did you choose to use for your inventory?

3. What other things might you include later in your inventory to make it more useful?


### Unit 14 Discussion Post 2
You have been noticing drift on your server configurations, so you want a way to 
generate a report on them every day to validate the configurations are the same.

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 3
Using ansible module for git, pull down this repo:
https://github.com/het-tanis/HPC_Deploy.git
1. How is the repo setup?
2. What is in the roles directory?
3. How are these playbooks called, and how do roles differ from tasks?

## Definitions/Terminology
- Automation: The act of taking a repetitive task and writing instructions to repeat it automatically, to reduce the need for manual intervention.

- Consistency: The ability to perform the same task or set of instructions across multiple systems without any variation. 

- Dev/Ops: Development/Operations. The point between software development and
  operations teams, streamlining software development, deployment, and maintenance.  
    * It's a methodology which integrates and automates the work of software development.
    * Specifically, on the operations side where environments are set up, configured, and deployed.  

- Timelines: A period of time that you have to complete a task.  
    * Performing tasks or updates quickly and reliably, to ensure systems remain
      current and secure.

- Git: A version control tool, the most popular one.
    * It's used to track changes in files and directories, stores all changes and
      previous versions of the files so that you can roll back if you need to.  

- Repository: A centralized storage location where you store a version-controlled project.  
    * Repositories can be local or remote.  
    * Remote repositories are hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  

- Ad-hoc: One-liners executed directly, without running a whole playbook.  
    * Used for quick, one time tasks like checking uptime or restarting services.  

- Playbook: A `yaml` file that contains a set of instructions for Ansible.  
    * Made up of a series of tasks, and optionally roles.  

- Task: A single set of instructions within a playbook. Uses an ansible module with arguments to achieve a specific outcome.  

- Role: A reusable/modular way to organize playbooks, tasks, variables, and templates in Ansible.  
    * A role can be included in any playbook, and that playbook will inherit
      everything inside of the role.  
    * A role has a directory structure to separate all of its components.  
    * E.g., Create a role with `ansible-galaxy init my_role` and it will
      generate a new directory with these subdirectories:
        * `tasks/`: Where you define the main tasks for the role.  
        * `handlers/`: Define handlers that are triggered with `notify` in `tasks`.  
        * `templates/`: Store `Jinja2` templates for dynamically generating files.  
        * `files/`: Store static files that can be copied to remote hosts.  
        * `vars/`: Define variables that are specific to the role.  
        * `defaults/`: Define default values for variables (these have the lowest precedence).  
        * `meta/`: Include metadata about the role, like depenencies.  

- SSH (Secure SHell): A protocol used to securely log in with a shell to a remote system.   
    * Ansible relies on SSH to connect to Linux/Unix systems. 

- WinRM (Windows Remote Management): A protocol used to manage and communicate with Windows systems remotely.  
    * Ansible uses WinRM for accessing Windows machines.

### Useful tools:

- Spyder ide


* Ansible Runner
    * Tool for consistently executing Ansible in an isolated and controlled environment
    * Decouples exeuction of ansible from AAP UI and backend logic
    * Easier to integrate Ansible Runner into tools other than AAP
    * Standardizes how a playbook is run. 

* Ansible Execution Environments
    * Container images that package ansible tasks and deps (ansible version, collection, python libs)
    * Removes the need for python virutal environments or installing packages onto AAP hosts
    * Easier to scale and distribute workloads
    * Bundle everything you need. OS, Python modules, etc
    * Can spawn as many instances of the container as you want.  

* ArgoCD for GitOps (continuous deployment)
* kargo - Multi-stage continuous promotion with GitOps. https://kargo.io/

---

* `dnsmasq`: PXE boot files 
* `matchbox`: Talos node configs 
* `HAProxy` (can be used as load balancer)
* `iSCSI` for talos storage
* NAS media storage
* `TimeMachine` backups

## Lab and Assignment

## Digging Deeper (optional)
1. I have a large amount of labs to get you started on your Ansible Journey (all free):
https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs

2. Find projects from our channel Ansible-Code, in Discord and find something that is interesting to you.

3. Use Ansible to access secrets from Hashicorp Vault: https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Hashicorp-Labs/004-vault-read-secrets-ansible

## Reflection Questions
1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How can you apply this now in your current role in IT? If youâ€™re not in IT, how can you look to put something like this into your resume or portfolio?
